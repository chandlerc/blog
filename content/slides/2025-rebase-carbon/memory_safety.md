Let's talk about the main show of safety though, pointer-like constructs.
Borrows in Rust, and `ref` bindings or pointers in Carbon.

Rust has a very simple and powerful model: mutable borrows must be exclusive,
while shared borrows must be immutable.

We expect to have a more complex safety model in Carbon specifically design to
let us express more code patterns and prove their memory safety: exclusive
pointers, immutable pointers, and _mutable non-exclusive_ pointers. This last
category is a big new set of complexity that Carbon is taking on.

## Motivation behind this model

{{% note %}}

Let's motivate this more complex model from some real-world examples of APIs
that we want to be able to migrate smoothly from C++ into Carbon.

These examples are directly based on real examples that C++ developers have
cited as challenges when moving to Rust's memory safety model.

Let's imagine a reasonably modern C++ wrapper API around this...

```

</div>
</div>

{{% note %}}

`EVP_AEAD_CTX_seal_scatter` encrypts and authenticates bytes from `in` and from
`ad`. It writes `in.size()` bytes of ciphertext to `out` and the authentication
tag to `out_tag`. It returns one on success and zero otherwise.

If `in` and `out` alias then `out == in`. `out_tag` may not alias any other
argument.

There are two ways this API can appear in a migration to memory safety in
Carbon:

1. The API and its implementation migrated to Carbon, along with callers
2. Just callers to the API migrated to Carbon, with a binding generated for the
   function.

### Rust migration

In both cases, this same migration to Rut can not be done mechanically, as the
API can not be represented directly in Rust:

1. The `in` and `out` can alias, but the `in` is `const` so that if they donâ€™t
   alias the function will not modify `in`. This is not expressible with
   immutable refs.
2. The `in` and `out` can alias while writing to `out`. This is not expressible
   with mutable refs.

So in Rust, youâ€™d need to split the API into two versions: an in-place one and a
non-in-place one. And then rewrite all callers to choose between the two based
on whether they have aliasing pointers or not, which may require non-local
knowledge to determine, pushing the same issue down the call stack. Once a
choice is made the callers have to be rewritten to work with the new API. This
introduces multiple non-trivial steps to a migration of the callers from C++ to
Rust. This may also require larger changes in callers in order to ensure
_exclusive_ access for any mutable pointers given.

### Carbon migration

Carbon can directly represent this API in both cases. A naive conversion to
Carbon can use the same loan parameter for all pointer arguments, allowing them
all to alias (aka to point to overlapping places).

This can then later be incrementally improved by splitting apart the loan
parameters, giving a unique one to each group of pointer parameters that do not
alias other groups. Note that none of the pointers impose exclusive access on
callers.

But this has more complexity, as it does require writing a lot of loan
parameters which you can omit in the migrated Rust APIs.

This uses a single loan parameter throughout, so anything can alias. This is not
what the docs say, but it is what the code says in C++. Now that we're in
Carbon, we can improve on this.

Now the aliasing can be specified without requiring splitting into two functions
with different APIs. Nothing can alias except in and out. This can be done
incrementally as a post-migration step.

Note that in can not be an immutable reference still, however. Since it can
alias with out we can only say that the view of the data through in will not be
used to mutate, which is what the pointer-to-const says.

Equivalent APIs for this _do_ exist in Rust, and we can look at how they are
structured...

{{% note %}}

These are actual Rust APIs for these operations. And maybe they're even _better_
APIs, that's a separate debate. But the real point here is that they have had to
use a very different shape, which makes migrating from the original API to these
a much larger change.

Carbon has to have a lot of extra complexity in order to model the original
shape of API, but a consequence is that the migration becomes much easier.

## Not all mutations are sound with aliasing...

{{% note %}}

We do still need to model exclusivity, and when supporting both we'll need to
handle the complexity of modeling the relationship between them.

Let's look at an even more complex real-world example that will let us examine
this in detail. This comes from the Dawn project.

```cpp{}
class DeviceBase {
 public:
  // Returns a pointer into an internal buffer.
  auto `GetInternalFormat`(wgpu::TextureFormat format) const
      -> `const Format*` {
    return &mFormatTable[ComputeFormatIndex(format)];
  }

  // Adds a value to an internal set.
  auto `EmitWarningOnce`(std::string_view message) -> void {
    `mWarnings.insert`(std::string{message});
  }

 private:
  std::array<Format, 109> `mFormatTable`;
  std::set<std::string> `mWarnings`;
};
```

---

```cpp{}
auto ValidateStorageTextureFormat(
    DeviceBase* device,
    wgpu::TextureFormat storageTextureFormat,
    wgpu::StorageTextureAccess access) -> MaybeError {
  // Holding a pointer into ``device``
  const Format* `format` =
      device->GetInternalFormat(storageTextureFormat);

  if (storageTextureFormat == wgpu::TextureFormat::BGRA8Unorm &&
      access == wgpu::StorageTextureAccess::ReadOnly) {
    // A shape change inside ``device``.
    `device->EmitWarningOnce`(
        "bgra8unorm with read-only access is deprecated.");
  }

  // Dereferencing the pointer after a shape change of ``device``.
  if (!TextureFormatSupportStorageAccess(`*format`, access)) {
    return ErrorData("Format does not support storage texture access.");
  }
  return {};
}
```

{{% note %}}

Here we know the "shape change" in `device` is orthogonal to the `format`
pointer. In fact, since the pointer comes from an `array`, it _canâ€™t_ be
invalidated by a shape change.

Nonetheless we'd expect this code to be rejected unless the two methods
`GetInternalFormat` and `EmitWarningOnce` can express that they do not touch
aliasing parts of `DeviceBase`.

    return &self.mFormatTable[ComputeFormatIndex(format)];
  }

  // Adds a value to an internal set.
  fn EmitWarningOnce[`ref` `exclusive` self: Self](message: Core.Str) {
    // insert() requires exclusive access to ``self.mWarnings`` which
    // requires exclusive access to ``self``.
    self.mWarnings.insert(Core.StrBuf.Make(message));
  }

  private var mFormatTable: array(Format, 109);
  private var mWarnings: Cpp.std.set(Core.StrBuf);
}

    device: DeviceBase `exclusive` *,

    access: Wgpu.StorageTextureAccess) -> MaybeError {
  // Holding a pointer into ``device``, holds a non-exclusive borrow on ``device``.
  let `format`: const Format`*` =
      `device`->GetInternalFormat(storageTextureFormat);

  if (storageTextureFormat == Wgpu.TextureFormat.BGRA8Unorm &&
      access == Wgpu.StorageTextureAccess.ReadOnly) {
    // ERROR under strict compilation, but allowed in permissive mode.
    // A shape change inside ``device``. Needs an exclusive borrow on ``device``
    `device->EmitWarningOnce`(
        "bgra8unorm with read-only access is deprecated.");

  // Dereferencing the pointer after a shape change of ``device``.
  if (!TextureFormatSupportStorageAccess(*format, access)) {
    return ErrorData("Format does not support storage texture access.");
  }
  return {};
}
```

{{% note %}}

This example requires holding a reference across a shape change of a `set`. Itâ€™s
not immediately a security bug because the reference is to a different part of
the larger class, not into the `set` that may be reallocated.

It will build in permission Carbon but be rejected in strict Carbon, unless we
extend the expressivity of the language enough to determine it is sound.

In Rust this code would always be rejected with safe constructs, and would be UB
with `unsafe` pointers.

In simpler cases, where the reference is held into the container being mutated
with a shape-changing allocation, we want to reject a migration into _strict_
Carbon as doing so is already a latent security bug.

When using an unsafe pointer to make it compile (similar to the permissive mode
in Carbon), Rust encounters _undefined behaviour_, while permissive Carbon does
not encounter undefined or erroneous behaviour in this example:
